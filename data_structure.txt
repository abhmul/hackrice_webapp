#1      The review administration system assumes some sort of object structure that has
        attributes as follows:

            User {
            id = #######
            name = "HackRice Team Member Bob"
            apps = ### - quota of apps to be reviewed
            due_date = mm/dd/yyyy - the due date for the MOST RECENTLY ADDED quota segment -> i.e. if there are overdue
                                    apps these are all grouped under the most recently given due date for the most
                                    recently assigned set of application reviews
            overdue = ### number of apps not completed before the present group of applications were assigned
            }
